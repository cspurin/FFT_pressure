# FFT_pressure 
There are 2 scripts the first one FFT_pressure plots the pressure data and transforms this pressure data into the frequency domain using a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for data in the standard Keller pressure transducer format. 
The second script FFT_function takes the input pressure in kPa and input time in seconds and does the same analysis. Here the user must convert the time into the correct format (of seconds) and not input date times. 


An example for the function is included. This is the pressure data using in this manuscript:
