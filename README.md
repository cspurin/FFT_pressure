# FFT_pressure 
There are 2 scripts:

1. **FFT_pressure** plots the pressure data and transforms this pressure data into the frequency domain using a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for data in the standard Keller pressure transducer format. 

2. **FFT_function** takes the input pressure in kPa and input time in seconds and does the same analysis. Here the user must convert the time into the correct format (of seconds) and not input date times. 


An example data set **pressure_ss** for the function is included. This is the pressure data used in this manuscript:
